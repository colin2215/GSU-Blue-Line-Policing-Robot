## Features

- **Route Mapping & Navigation**: Utilizes the Google Maps API to define a safe path along sidewalks around Georgia State University Blue Line.
- **Proximity Detection**: Equipped with GoPiGo3 proximity sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, enabling seamless autonomous movement along the designated route.
- **Noise Detection**: A microphone monitors noise levels to detect abnormal sounds, such as shouting or crashing.
- **Vision-Based Detection**: Integrates a pre-trained violence detection model to identify violent behavior and potential weapons while live-streaming the feed.
- **Siren Activation**: When a threat is detected, the robot activates a siren light and emits a siren sound to alert people nearby.
- **Automated Notifications**: Sends an automatic email notification to designated recipients, providing real-time alerts about the detected threat.
